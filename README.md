Notes:

It took me 6 hours to take the project to the point at b807d61c43f45cc195de4d07afff6245ddf2fcac.

I expended most of the time defining a level's structure, its segments, how they form a piecewise bezier curve and how they would be created on editor time.

The most challenging part I tackled was how to move the character smoothly over a bezier curve, which I ended avoiding given the time constraints. As it is I'm doing the simplest which is moving the bezier's parameter smoothly over time, which won't give me the result I wanted.
I didn't manage to take the main logic and UI too far, so I would try to keep working on that.

I would actually take it to an usable state. But there is still work to be done for level obstacles, level creation, game services.

I think the experience was quite interesting, at lest for me to see how I react to such time constrained environments and how could I changes my approach to development.
